### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is JoÃ£o Maroeli from Brazil (:flag_br:). I've always been passionate by coding and technology in general, but just recently started working on it. I'm constantly amazed by what we can do in modern society, I really want to be able to learn an experience all I can.

In my spare time I like to play games (:video_game:), read books (:books:), watch movies and series (:movie_camera:), stay in touch with friends (:fallen_leaf:) and sometimes wander around the dangerous parts of the internet! (reddit) 
I also am very interested in science in general, more specificaly biology. Not an expert, but someday I will get there. (:microscope:)

Feel free to contact me!
