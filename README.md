### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is JoÃ£o Maroeli from Brazil. I've always been passionate by coding and technology in general, but just recently started working on it. I'm constantly amazed by what we can do in modern society, I really want to be able to learn an experience all I can.

In my spare time I like to play games (:video_game:), read books (:books:), watch movies and series (:movie_camera:), stay in touch with friends (:fallen_leaf:) and sometimes wander around the dangerous parts of the internet! (reddit) 
I also am very interested in science in general, more specificaly biology. Not an expert, but someday I will get there. (:microscope:)

Feel free to contact me!
